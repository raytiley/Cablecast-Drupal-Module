# Cablecast Drupal Module

This goal of this module is to sync all your Cablecast content as Drupal nodes so it can be a first class citizen in your Drupal site.

# Versions
The 7.x-1.x is frozen and will not be updated. It inadveranatly introduced changes that broke between major versions of Cablecast. To fix this two branches were created that support different verions of Cablecast.

| Drupal Module Version  |   Cablecast Version | Notes  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  7.x-1.x |  > 6.0 |  This is unsupported use 7.x-3.x instead. |

|  7.x-3.x |  > 6.0 |  This versions supports Cablecast versions after 6.0 including the latest release of Cablecast. |
